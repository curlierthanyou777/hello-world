# hello-world
gotta start somewhere!

My name is Lauren and I live in Pittsburgh, PA. I'm a software manual tester and am starting to learn test automation now. However, my degree isn't in software.... I'm a biomedical engineer from RIT- class of 2017! So this job is my first one out of collage and it's been great so far. 

Professional things aside- I have many hobbies mainly centered around crafting. Crocheting is the big one but I'm currently focused on origami. Other hobbies include health/fitness- I'm a marathoner and CrossFitter as well as a health coach!
